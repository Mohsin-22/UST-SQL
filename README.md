SQL ASSIGNMENT QUERIES

Q1) Find all employees whose first names start with a vowel and whose last names end with a consonant. 

Q2) For each department, display the total salary expenditure, the average salary, and the highest salary. Use window functions to calculate the total, average, and max salary, but show each result for all employees in that department.


 Q3) Write a query that fetches the following:
All employees, their department name, their manager’s name (if they have one), and their salary.

Q4) Create a query using a recursive CTE to list all employees and their respective reporting chains (i.e., list the manager’s manager and so on).

Q5) Write a query to fetch the details of employees earning above a certain salary threshold. Investigate the performance of this query and suggest improvements, including the use of indexes.

Q6) OU need to create a detailed sales report. First, create a temporary table to store interim sales data for each product, including total sales, average sales per customer, and the top salesperson for each product.
